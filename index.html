        <p>So it seems that these people that call themselves "The Chosen" are part of a large cult on this desolate planet.I have been chosen to become a test subject for their experiments, I hope I can make it out of here to my family.</p>

        <p>They gave me many injections last week. It took awhile for the pain to finally go away completely though I do feel different from before. I feel stronger,...faster, maybe even more...bloodthirsty? I dont know what all they did to me but I am trying to find an escape from this place.</p>

        <p>It was horrible, so many... beasts. It seems that these monsters are the orignal inhabitants of this not so desolate world. There were hundreds of them and they tore the the Chapel with ease. There were around a thousand of us in that place and it seems only a handful of us escaped. There are only twenty of us here though I dont know if there are other groups that managed to escape. </p>

        <p>It has been awhile since my last post because my group has had to keep moving for the past months. We've lost about half of our group along the way and we haven't met anyone else on a travels. Luckily we have obtained weapons from the monsters we destroyed. I think we can all get out of here since I believe I saw a ship yard a few miles away.</p>
